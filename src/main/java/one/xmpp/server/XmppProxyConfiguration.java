     * The backlog argument provides a hint to the implementation which the implementation shall use
     * to limit the number of outstanding connections in the socketâ€™s listen queue. Implementations
     * may impose a limit on backlog and silently reduce the specified value. Normally, a larger
     * backlog argument value shall result in a larger or equal length of the listen queue.
     * Implementations shall support values of backlog up to SOMAXCONN, defined in socket.h. The
     * implementation may include incomplete connections in its listen queue. The limits on the
     * number of incomplete connections and completed connections queued may be different. The
     * implementation may have an upper limit on the length of the listen queue-either global or per
     * accepting socket. If backlog exceeds this limit, the length of the listen queue is set to the
     * limit. If listen() is called with a backlog argument value that is less than 0, the function
     * behaves as if it had been called with a backlog argument value of 0. A backlog argument of 0
     * may allow the socket to accept connections, in which case the length of the listen queue may
     * be set to an implementation-defined minimum value. (POSIX documentation)
